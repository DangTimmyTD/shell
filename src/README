How to execute the shell
------------------------
<describe how to execute from the command line>
	From terminal, change directory to the location of the files. Use command
'make' to compile the shell. Then use command ' ./esh ' to run the shell.


Important Notes
---------------
<Any important notes about your system>

The signal handler for Ctrl+Z is not working, therefore we are also failing
the test for fg, and jobs even though they work.
	


Description of Base Functionality
---------------------------------
<describe your IMPLEMENTATION of the following commands:
jobs, fg, bg, kill, stop, \ˆC, \ˆZ >
	First we get the name of the command, and then the arguments that were
pass in. We have an helper function that test if the inputed command are 
build-in or not. If the command is not a build-in commands, then we call
another helper function that fork the shell, and if succussful, execute the 
program, the first argument, and pass in the rest of the arguments. If the 
command contains '&' or if there's already a program in the foreground, then 
we run the program in the background. We used If-statements to determine which
command the user has inputed. If the command was jobs, then the list of jobs 
would be printed in chronological order, with it's current status and command.
If it were fb, gb, kill or stop, then we would check the target's (argument's) 
status and determine the action to perform.
